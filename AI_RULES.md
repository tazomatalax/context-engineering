# AI Project Template Rules

### 🔄 Project Awareness & Context

- **Read the README.md** to understand the project structure and purpose.
- **Use consistent naming conventions, file structure, and architecture patterns** as demonstrated in the codebase.
- **Respect the `.vscode/mcp.json` configuration** for tool usage.

### 🧱 Code Structure & Modularity

- **Keep files focused and small.** If a file approaches 500 lines, refactor.
- **Organize code into clearly separated modules**, grouped by feature or responsibility.
- **Use clear, consistent imports.**

### 🧪 Testing & Reliability

- **Create tests for new features.**
- **Ensure tests pass before considering a task complete.**

### 📚 Documentation & Explainability

- **Update `README.md`** when new features are added.
- **Comment non-obvious code.**

### 🧠 AI Behavior Rules

- **Never assume missing context. Ask questions if uncertain.**
- **Never hallucinate libraries or functions.**
- **Always confirm file paths and module names** exist before referencing them.
