# This is the validation script for your project. It acts as a Quality Gate
# that the AI must pass before work is considered complete.
#
# --- ACTION REQUIRED ---
# You must configure this script with the specific commands for your project.
# The AI assistant can help you with this.
#
# Example for a Node.js project:
# echo "Running Linter..."
# npx eslint .
# echo "Running Tests..."
# npm test
#
# Example for a Python project:
# echo "Running Linter..."
# ruff check .
# echo "Running Type Checker..."
# mypy .
# echo "Running Tests..."
# pytest

echo "âœ… Validation script is ready for configuration."
# Exit with success code 0 so the initial setup doesn't fail.
