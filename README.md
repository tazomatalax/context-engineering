**🎯 The Problem:** AI assistants hallucinate libraries, ignore patterns, break tests  
**💡 The Solution:** Systematic context engineering with validation loops  
**📈 The Result:** AI that follows your conventions and passes quality gates

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install the Toolkit

**Option A: Universal Installation (No Node.js required)**
```bash
# Navigate to your existing project
cd your-existing-project

# Install using universal script
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tazomatalax/context-engineering/main/install.sh | bash

# OR clone and run locally:
git clone https://github.com/tazomatalax/context-engineering.git
cd context-engineering && ./install.sh
```

**Option B: NPX Installation (Node.js required)**
```bash
# Navigate to your existing project
cd your-existing-project

# Install Context Engineering toolkit
npx context-engineering-installer
```

**Both methods then require:**
```bash
# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your GitHub credentials
```

### 2. Draft a Plan from an Idea

```bash
# In Claude Code, describe your goal
/create-task "Add a dark mode toggle to the settings page"
```

This creates a detailed plan in `temp/task-draft-{timestamp}.md`.

### 3. Finalize and Post the Plan

```bash
# Review and edit the draft file, then post it to GitHub
node scripts/post-issue.js temp/task-draft-{...}.md
```

### 4. Start the Task

```bash
# This fetches the full plan (issue + comments) into a local file
/start-task --issue=123
```

### 5. Execute and Submit

```bash
# The AI implements the plan, running ./validate.sh until it passes
/execute-prp PRPs/active/123-add-dark-mode-toggle.md

# Finally, submit the completed work as a Pull Request
/submit-pr --issue=123
```

### The Plan → Execute → Submit Workflow

Context Engineering follows a streamlined **Plan → Execute → Submit** workflow that prioritizes team collaboration and real-world usability.

## What is Context Engineering?

Context Engineering represents a paradigm shift from traditional prompt engineering:

### Prompt Engineering vs Context Engineering

**Prompt Engineering:**
- Focuses on clever wording and specific phrasing
- Limited to how you phrase a task
- Like giving someone a sticky note

**Context Engineering:**
- A complete system for providing comprehensive context
- Includes documentation, examples, rules, patterns, and validation
- Like writing a full screenplay with all the details

### Why Context Engineering Matters

1. **Reduces AI Failures**: Most agent failures aren't model failures - they're context failures
2. **Ensures Consistency**: AI follows your project patterns and conventions
3. **Enables Complex Features**: AI can handle multi-step implementations with proper context
4. **Self-Correcting**: Validation loops allow AI to fix its own mistakes

## The Plan → Execute → Submit Workflow

The new workflow prioritizes **real-world usability, safety, and collaboration** over rigid automation:

    end

    subgraph "Phase 2: Execute & Validate"
        C --> D{AI pulls the full plan for local execution};
        D --> E{AI implements code and runs validation loops};
    end

        E --> F[AI helps submit PR with Dev Notes];
    end

```

### Workflow Commands

#### For New Tasks (Plan from Scratch):
```bash
# 1. Create comprehensive task from minimal prompt
/create-task "Add dark mode toggle to settings"

# 2. Edit the generated draft, then post to GitHub
node scripts/post-issue.js temp/task-draft-{timestamp}.md

# 3. Fetch complete context and start implementation  
/start-task --issue=123

# 4. Execute the comprehensive plan
/execute-prp PRPs/active/123-feature-name.md

# 5. Submit with AI-generated developer notes
/submit-pr --issue=123
```

#### For Simple Manual Issues (Refine Existing):
```bash
# 1. Refine a simple issue created by PM/teammate
/refine-task --issue=123

# 2. Fetch complete context after refinement
/start-task --issue=123

# 3. Execute the comprehensive plan  
/execute-prp PRPs/active/123-feature-name.md

# 4. Submit with AI-generated developer notes
/submit-pr --issue=123
```

### Key Advantages

- **GitHub Issues as Single Source of Truth**: The plan lives on GitHub for full team visibility
- **Minimally Invasive Installation**: Safe file deployment without project analysis
- **AI-Assisted Guided Configuration**: Collaborate with AI to configure for your specific project
- **Graceful Handling of Unstructured Inputs**: Convert simple ideas into actionable plans
- **Automate Toil, Not Thinking**: Automate repetitive tasks while keeping humans in control

## Installation and Setup

### 1. Install the Toolkit

**Method 1: Universal Installer (Recommended - No Node.js required)**

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd your-existing-project

# Install via curl (Linux/macOS/WSL)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tazomatalax/context-engineering/main/install.sh | bash

# OR clone and install locally (works everywhere)
git clone https://github.com/tazomatalax/context-engineering.git
cd context-engineering && ./install.sh

# Windows users: Use install.bat instead
install.bat
```

**Method 2: NPX Installer (Node.js required)**

```bash
# In your existing project directory
npx context-engineering-installer

# To uninstall later if needed
npx context-engineering-installer --uninstall
```

**Why Universal Installer?**
- ✅ Works without Node.js/npm installed
- ✅ More reliable on different platforms
- ✅ Uses shell scripts instead of Node.js dependencies
- ✅ Simpler error handling and debugging

### 2. Configure Environment

```bash
# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Edit with your GitHub credentials
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_personal_access_token_here
GITHUB_REPO=owner/repo-name
```

**Creating a GitHub Personal Access Token:**
1. Go to GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
2. Generate a new token with `repo` scope
3. Copy the token to your `.env` file

### 3. Configure Validation Script

The installer creates a generic `validate.sh` template. Configure it for your project:

```bash
# For Node.js projects, uncomment:
# npx eslint .
# npm test

# For Python projects, uncomment:
# ruff check .
# pytest
```

Your AI assistant can help configure this script for your specific project needs.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"GITHUB_TOKEN is required"**
- Ensure `.env` file exists with valid GitHub token
- Token needs `repo` scope for private repositories

**"validate.sh not executable"**
- Run `chmod +x validate.sh` on Unix systems
- On Windows, this is usually not needed

**"No changes to commit"**
- Ensure you've implemented code changes before running `/submit-pr`
- Or switch to your existing feature branch before running `/submit-pr`
- Check `git status` to see current changes

**Script Usage Errors**
- Always use the exact format: `/submit-pr --issue=123`
- Scripts work from any directory within your project
- Environment variables are automatically detected from project root
- Use `--notes-file=temp/pr-notes.md` for custom developer notes

**Installation fails**
- Ensure you're in a project directory (not empty folder)  
- Check that you have write permissions in the directory
- For universal installer: ensure `curl` or `wget` is installed
- For Windows: ensure PowerShell execution policy allows downloads

**Want to remove the toolkit?**
- NPX method: `npx context-engineering-installer --uninstall`
- Universal method: Remove files manually using the file list from installation output
- The uninstaller will show exactly what will be deleted before proceeding

**Scripts not working?**
- Universal installer creates platform-specific validation scripts (`validate.sh` for Unix, `validate.bat` for Windows)
- Scripts auto-detect project types and use appropriate tools
- All dependencies are clearly listed and validated before running
