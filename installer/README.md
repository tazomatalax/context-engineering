# Context Engineering Installer

Simple installer for adding Context Engineering workflow to any existing project.

Context Engineering is a discipline for providing AI coding assistants with comprehensive project context - your actual patterns, dependencies, and validation requirements - so they can implement features correctly the first time.

## Prerequisites

- **Claude Code CLI**: This toolkit requires [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) to function
- **Node.js 16+**: For running the installation and GitHub integration scripts
- **Git repository**: Your project should be a Git repository for full workflow benefits

## üöÄ Quick Install

```bash
# Install in any existing project directory
npx context-engineering-installer

# To uninstall later
npx context-engineering-installer --uninstall
```

## ‚ú® What It Does

The installer is a **simple delivery service** that copies toolkit files to your project:

1. **No Analysis**: No project detection or smart configuration - just reliable file deployment
2. **Safe Copying**: Uses `overwrite: false` to never replace your existing files
3. **Complete Toolkit**: All commands, templates, and scripts in one package
4. **Clean Uninstall**: Easy removal when you want to experiment or clean up

## üìÅ What Gets Installed

### Core AI Commands
- `.claude/commands/` - All 6 Context Engineering commands:
  - `create-task.md` - Create comprehensive issue drafts
  - `refine-task.md` - Enrich simple manual issues  
  - `start-task.md` - Fetch complete context for execution
  - `execute-prp.md` - Implement features from plans
  - `validate-execution.md` - AI code review (optional)
  - `submit-pr.md` - Submit PRs with developer notes

### GitHub Integration
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature-request.yml` - Structured issue template
- `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` - PR template with validation checklist

### Automation Scripts
- `scripts/generation/generate-from-issue.js` - Fetch GitHub issues ‚Üí PRPs
- `scripts/submission/submit-pr.js` - Create PRs with developer notes

### Configuration & Templates
- `PRPs/templates/prp_base.md` - Base PRP template
- `PRPs/active/` - Directory for active development plans
- `temp/` - Directory for issue drafts
- `.env.example` - Environment variables template
- `validate.sh` - Quality gate script (requires customization)
- `AI_RULES.md` - Project-specific AI assistant rules
- `advanced_tools.md` - Optional AI power-ups guide

## üîß After Installation

### 1. Configure Environment
```bash
# Copy and edit environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Add your GitHub credentials:
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_personal_access_token_here
GITHUB_REPO=owner/repo-name
```

### 2. Configure Validation Script
The installer creates a **smart validation script** that auto-detects your project type and runs appropriate checks:

```bash
# Test it works out of the box
./validate.sh

# It automatically detects and runs:
# - npm run lint/test (Node.js projects)
# - ruff check, pytest (Python projects) 
# - Git status checks (all projects)
```

**üéØ For best results, customize the script:**
- Uncomment the examples at the bottom of `validate.sh`
- Add your project-specific commands
- Your AI assistant can help configure this for your needs

**üí° The script is designed to be robust** - it won't fail if tools aren't installed, but will give helpful warnings.

### 3. Verify Installation

Confirm the installation worked:

```bash
# Check that commands are available (restart Claude Code first)
ls .claude/commands/

# Verify GitHub integration
node scripts/generation/generate-from-issue.js --help
```

## üöÄ Your New Workflow

Once configured, use the streamlined Context Engineering workflow:

```bash
# 1. Create comprehensive issue from brief idea
/create-task "Add dark mode toggle to settings"

# 2. Edit the generated draft, then post to GitHub  
node scripts/post-issue.cjs temp/task-draft-{timestamp}.md

# 3. Start implementation (fetches full context)
/start-task --issue=123

# 4. Execute the plan (AI implements with validation)
/execute-prp PRPs/active/123-add-dark-mode-toggle.md

# 5. Submit with AI-generated developer notes
/submit-pr --issue=123
```

## üßπ Clean Uninstall

When you want to remove the toolkit:

```bash
npx context-engineering-installer --uninstall
```

The uninstaller will:
- Show exactly what files will be removed
- Ask for confirmation before deleting anything
- Remove all toolkit files and empty directories
- Leave your project files completely untouched

Perfect for experimentation or trying Context Engineering on multiple projects.

## üéØ Design Philosophy

This installer follows the **"Delivery Service" approach**:

- ‚úÖ **Reliable**: Simple file copying with no complex logic to break
- ‚úÖ **Safe**: Never overwrites existing files
- ‚úÖ **Predictable**: Same files installed every time
- ‚úÖ **Reversible**: Clean uninstall removes everything
- ‚úÖ **Transparent**: You can see exactly what's being installed

**No more:**
- ‚ùå Project analysis that might guess wrong  
- ‚ùå Smart configuration that breaks on edge cases
- ‚ùå Complex logic that fails in unexpected ways
- ‚ùå Permanent installation that's hard to remove

## üîÑ Updates

To update to a newer version:

```bash
# Uninstall current version
npx context-engineering-installer --uninstall

# Install latest version  
npx context-engineering-installer@latest
```

Your customizations in `validate.sh` and `.env` will be preserved since the installer never overwrites existing files.

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Installation Issues
- **Permission denied**: Ensure you have write permissions in the directory
- **Files already exist**: Installer skips existing files (this is normal)
- **Wrong directory**: Make sure you're in your project root

### After Installation
- **Commands not found**: Restart Claude Code to pick up new `.claude/commands/`
- **GitHub errors**: Check your `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `GITHUB_REPO` in `.env`
- **Validation fails**: Customize `validate.sh` with your project's commands

### Module Compatibility
- **Universal compatibility**: Scripts use `.cjs` extension to work in all project types
- **No configuration needed**: Works with both CommonJS and ES module projects
- **Reliable**: Node.js always treats `.cjs` files as CommonJS regardless of project settings

### Uninstall Issues
- **Files not removed**: Some files may have been customized (this is intentional)
- **Directories remain**: Empty parent directories are automatically cleaned up
