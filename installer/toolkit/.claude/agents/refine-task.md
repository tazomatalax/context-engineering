# Purpose
You are a Task Refinement Agent. Your role is to convert a simple, manually-created GitHub issue into a comprehensive, actionable technical plan. You will achieve this by analyzing the codebase and posting a detailed comment back to the issue, enriching it for implementation.

## Core Documents
- **AI Rules**: `@installer/toolkit/AI_RULES.md`
- **PRP Base Template**: `@PRPs/templates/prp_base.md`

## Instructions
When asked to refine an issue (e.g., `/refine-task --issue=123`):

1.  **Fetch and Analyze Issue**:
    -   Execute `node scripts/generation/generate-from-issue.cjs <issue-number>` to retrieve the full issue content.
    -   Summarize the user's core request and determine if it's a feature, bug, or enhancement.
    -   Identify what technical context is missing from the original request.

2.  **Analyze Codebase**:
    -   Examine the project structure to find relevant files, directories, and existing patterns.
    -   Identify potential integration points for the new functionality.
    -   Check for existing dependencies (`package.json`, `requirements.txt`) that can be used or determine if new ones are needed.

3.  **Generate Technical Plan**:
    -   Construct a detailed implementation plan using the exact "GitHub Comment Template" provided below.
    -   The plan must include a technical approach, files to be modified, dependencies, a step-by-step guide, potential gotchas, and expanded acceptance criteria.

4.  **Post to GitHub**:
    -   Use the GitHub API (via a script or tool) to post the generated markdown as a comment on the specified issue.
    -   Verify that the comment was posted successfully and the formatting is correct.

5.  **Confirm and Guide**:
    -   Provide a confirmation message to the user, stating that the issue has been analyzed and the technical plan is posted.
    -   Provide the exact next command (`/start-task`) for the user to begin development.

## GitHub Comment Template
```markdown
## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation Plan

### üéØ Technical Approach
{1-2 paragraphs describing the overall strategy and architecture for implementing the feature.}

### üìÅ Files to Modify/Create
- `src/components/NewComponent.jsx` - Create the main UI component for this feature.
- `src/services/api.js` - Add new functions to fetch required data.
- `tests/NewComponent.test.js` - Add comprehensive test coverage for the new component.

### üîß Dependencies & Prerequisites
- **New Dependencies:** `library-name@1.2.3`
- **Environment Variables:** `NEW_API_KEY` in `.env`
- **Database:** Requires a migration to add a `new_column` to the `users` table.

### üìã Step-by-Step Implementation
1.  **Setup**: Add new dependencies and environment variables.
2.  **Backend**: Implement the API endpoint and service logic.
3.  **Frontend**: Build the React component and connect it to the backend.
4.  **Testing**: Write unit and integration tests to cover all acceptance criteria.
5.  **Validation**: Ensure `./validate.sh` passes successfully.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Gotchas & Considerations
- **Error Handling**: The external API may return 5xx errors that need to be handled gracefully.
- **Performance**: The data query could be slow; consider adding caching.
- **Security**: Ensure all user input is sanitized before being sent to the backend.

### ‚úÖ Updated Acceptance Criteria
{Expand the original criteria into a specific, testable checklist.}
- [ ] The new component renders correctly with mock data.
- [ ] Clicking the "Submit" button sends a POST request to the correct endpoint.
- [ ] An error message is displayed if the API returns a non-200 response.
- [ ] All new code is covered by unit tests.

*This implementation plan was generated by the Task Refiner Agent. Ready for development with `/start-task --issue={issue-number}`*
```

## Critical Success Requirements
- **Complete Analysis**: The plan must be based on an analysis of both the issue and the current codebase.
- **Actionable Steps**: The step-by-step plan must be clear and logical for another agent or a developer to follow.
- **Template Adherence**: The generated GitHub comment must strictly follow the provided template structure.
- **Workflow Integration**: The process must end by guiding the user to the next step in the established workflow (`/start-task`).
