# Execute PRP Implementation

Implement a feature using the specified PRP file with systematic validation.

## Command: `/execute-prp <path-to-prp-file>`

## MANDATORY EXECUTION SEQUENCE

### PHASE 1: CONTEXT LOADING (Required)
1. **Read PRP File Completely**
   ```
   ‚úÖ CHECKPOINT: Can you summarize the main objective in 1 sentence?
   ‚úÖ CHECKPOINT: Can you list all acceptance criteria?
   ‚úÖ CHECKPOINT: Do you understand all technical requirements?
   ```

2. **Validate Prerequisites**
   - Check if `.env` exists and has required variables
   - Verify `validate.sh` is executable
   - Confirm all referenced files/directories exist
   ```
   ‚ùå IF ANY MISSING: Stop and request user to configure prerequisites
   ‚úÖ IF ALL PRESENT: Continue to Phase 2
   ```

### PHASE 2: IMPLEMENTATION PLANNING (Required)
3. **Create Implementation Plan Using TodoWrite**
   - Break PRP into specific, testable tasks (max 10 items)
   - Each task must have clear completion criteria
   - Include validation steps for each major component
   ```
   EXAMPLE GOOD TASK: "Create user login form with email/password fields and submit button"
   EXAMPLE BAD TASK: "Implement authentication system"
   ```

4. **Identify Implementation Patterns**
   - Search codebase for similar existing features
   - Note file structure patterns to follow
   - Identify imports/dependencies to use
   ```
   ‚úÖ CHECKPOINT: Have you found at least 2 similar code patterns to follow?
   ```

### PHASE 3: STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION (Required)
5. **Execute Each Todo Item**
   - Mark todo as `in_progress` before starting
   - Implement the specific functionality
   - Test the implementation works
   - Mark todo as `completed` only when working
   ```
   üîÑ RULE: Only 1 todo can be `in_progress` at a time
   üîÑ RULE: Must test each component before marking complete
   ```
### IMPLEMENTATION NOTES (MANDATORY)

   - Rule: Append one short Implementation Notes entry to the PRP `## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Notes` section at these checkpoints: (A) after planning, (B) before starting each todo, (C) after completing each todo (include validation), (D) final completion.
   - Entry must be exactly the minimal template below (replace bracketed tokens). Keep entries concise: one paragraph, preferably one line (max 6 lines).

   Template (one-paragraph, single block):
   ```
   [TIMESTAMP] | [TASK] | [STATUS: pending|in_progress|completed] | files: file1,file2 | cmds: "./validate.sh:EXIT" "pnpm -w vitest:RESULT" | note: short next-step or failure-reason
   ```

   - Enforcement: do not mark a task `completed` unless `./validate.sh` exit is 0 or test evidence is recorded in `cmds`. If `./validate.sh` fails, append an entry with STATUS `failed` and STOP (do not continue other todos) and surface the failure excerpt to the user.

   - PR Integration: The `/submit-pr` script consumes this section verbatim for the PR body. Avoid long prose or code blocks. Focus on: what changed, how validated, and next step.

### PHASE 4: CONTINUOUS VALIDATION (Required)
6. **After Each Major Component**
   ```bash
   # Run project-specific validation
   ./validate.sh
   
   # IF FAILS:
   #   - Fix the specific errors shown
   #   - Re-run validate.sh
   #   - Do NOT continue until passing
   ```

### PHASE 5: FINAL VALIDATION (CRITICAL)
7. **Complete PRP Validation**
   ```bash
   # MANDATORY: Must pass before completion
   ./validate.sh
   ```
   ```
   ‚ùå IF VALIDATE.SH FAILS: Implementation is NOT complete
   ‚úÖ IF VALIDATE.SH PASSES: Continue to final check
   ```

8. **PRP Completion Verification**
   - Re-read original PRP file
   - Verify each acceptance criteria is met
   - Check all technical requirements implemented
   ```
   ‚úÖ CHECKPOINT: Can you demonstrate each acceptance criteria works?
   ‚úÖ CHECKPOINT: Are all TodoWrite items marked as completed?
   ‚úÖ CHECKPOINT: Does `./validate.sh` pass with exit code 0?
   ```

## ERROR HANDLING DECISION TREE

```
VALIDATION FAILS?
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Linting Errors ‚Üí Fix syntax, re-run validate.sh
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Test Failures ‚Üí Fix failing tests, re-run validate.sh  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Build Errors ‚Üí Fix build issues, re-run validate.sh
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Type Errors ‚Üí Fix type issues, re-run validate.sh

IMPLEMENTATION BLOCKED?
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Missing Dependencies ‚Üí Check PRP for required packages
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Unclear Requirements ‚Üí Re-read PRP and ask for clarification
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Code Pattern Unclear ‚Üí Search codebase for similar examples
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Technical Issue ‚Üí Break down into smaller todos

PRP REQUIREMENTS UNCLEAR?
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Acceptance Criteria Vague ‚Üí Ask user to clarify specific criteria
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Technical Details Missing ‚Üí Request additional context
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Conflicting Information ‚Üí Ask user to resolve conflicts
```

## SUCCESS CRITERIA CHECKLIST

- [ ] All TodoWrite items marked as `completed`
- [ ] `./validate.sh` passes with exit code 0
- [ ] Each PRP acceptance criteria demonstrably works
- [ ] Code follows existing project patterns
- [ ] No console errors or warnings
- [ ] Implementation matches PRP technical requirements

## FAILURE HANDLING

If you cannot complete the PRP:
1. Report exactly which acceptance criteria are blocked
2. List specific technical obstacles encountered  
3. Show current state of TodoWrite progress
4. Provide specific next steps needed for completion
