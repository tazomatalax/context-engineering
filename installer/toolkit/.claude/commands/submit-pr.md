# Submit Pull Request

Create and submit a pull request. By default, the script embeds the PRP's Implementation Notes into the PR body to minimize token usage.

## Command: `/submit-pr --issue=<issue-number>`

## MANDATORY EXECUTION SEQUENCE

### PHASE 1: VALIDATION & PREPARATION (Required)

1. **Validate Prerequisites**
   ```bash
   # Check these requirements:
   ✅ .env file exists with GITHUB_TOKEN and GITHUB_REPO
   ✅ Git repository with changes to commit
   ✅ ./validate.sh has passed successfully  
   ✅ scripts/submission/submit-pr.cjs exists
   ✅ Issue number is valid
   ```

2. **Verify Implementation Quality**
   ```bash
   # MANDATORY: Final validation must pass
   ./validate.sh
   ```
   ```
   ❌ IF VALIDATE.SH FAILS: Stop and fix issues before proceeding
   ✅ IF VALIDATE.SH PASSES: Continue to Phase 2
   ```

3. **Check Git Status**
   ```bash
   git status --porcelain
   ```
   ```
   ❌ IF NO CHANGES: Error "No changes to commit"
   ✅ IF CHANGES EXIST: Continue to developer notes generation
   ```

### PHASE 2: NOTES HANDLING (Required)

4. **Use PRP Implementation Notes (Default Path)**
   - Do not generate separate notes by default. The `submit-pr.cjs` script automatically extracts the PRP section `## �️ Implementation Notes` and embeds it in the PR body.
   - Keep your PRP Implementation Notes concise — the script consumes them verbatim.

5. **Optional: Add Supplemental Developer Notes**
   - If you want to add curated notes in addition to the PRP notes, create file: `temp/pr-notes-{issue-number}.md` and pass `--notes-file` to the script. This will appear as a separate "Developer Notes" section.
   - Fallback/Flags:
     - `--no-prp-notes` to skip PRP notes entirely
     - `--collapse-prp-notes` to wrap PRP notes in a collapsible section

### PHASE 3: GIT OPERATIONS (Required)

6. **Branch Management**
   ```bash
   # Check current branch
   CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
   
   # If on main/master, create feature branch
   if [[ "$CURRENT_BRANCH" == "main" || "$CURRENT_BRANCH" == "master" ]]; then
     git checkout -b "feature/issue-{issue-number}"
   fi
   ```

7. **Commit Changes**
   ```bash
   # Stage all changes
   git add .
   
   # Create conventional commit message
   git commit -m "feat(issue-{issue-number}): {issue-title}

   Implements: #{issue-number}

   ```

### PHASE 4: PULL REQUEST CREATION (Required)

8. **Execute Submission Script**
   ```bash
   # Default: auto-embeds PRP Implementation Notes
   node scripts/submission/submit-pr.cjs --issue={issue-number}

   # Optional: include curated Developer Notes
   node scripts/submission/submit-pr.cjs --issue={issue-number} --notes-file=temp/pr-notes-{issue-number}.md

   # Flags:
   #   --no-prp-notes        # do not include PRP Implementation Notes
   #   --collapse-prp-notes  # wrap PRP notes in a collapsible section
   ```

9. **Validate Submission Success**
   ```
   SUBMISSION CHECKLIST:
   ✅ Branch pushed to remote repository
   ✅ Pull request created successfully
   ✅ PR linked to original issue (closes #{issue-number})
   ✅ PRP Implementation Notes included in PR body (unless --no-prp-notes)
   ✅ Developer notes (if notes-file used) included in PR body
   ✅ Comment posted on original issue with PR link
   ```

### PHASE 5: CLEANUP & CONFIRMATION (Required)

10. **Post-Submission Actions**
    ```bash
    # Switch back to main branch
    git checkout main
    
    # Provide user with PR URL and next steps
    ```

11. **Provide User Confirmation**
    ```

## INTEGRATION WITH WORKFLOW

This command completes the Context Engineering workflow:

1. `/create-task "feature description"` → Draft comprehensive issue
2. `node scripts/post-issue.cjs temp/task-draft-*.md` → Post to GitHub
3. `/start-task --issue=123` → Fetch complete context  
4. `/execute-prp PRPs/active/123-*.md` → Implement feature
5. `/submit-pr --issue=123` → **Submit for review**

**Result:** Feature is implemented, validated, and ready for team review with AI-generated developer notes.
